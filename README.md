# Description

This is a base library to initialize and access all Odroid GO hardware. Its main goal is to make porting existing applications easy
by providing a simple abstraction. It isn't meant to write new applications as the audio and video capabilities are very basic, please consider using Arduino or libraries such as uGFX.
